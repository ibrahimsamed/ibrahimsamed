Hello, I'm Ibrahim. I graduated from the Electronics and Communication Engineering department. I strongly believe that students
in this field should have a comprehensive understanding of the journey from electrical circuits to end-user products such as
websites, social media platforms, GPS systems, and more. To achieve this, I have delved into various areas including digital
circuit design, embedded systems, communication projects utilizing USRP, and machine learning. Recently, I've shifted my
focus towards web development and applications, embarking on a full-stack adventure. Consequently, I've begun sharing insights
through repo covering electronics, programming, and communication. I hope you find them valuable.
